a close attempt writing a c project merger, 

still, end up with manual merge, but a good habit of doing any merge in the future:

1.top level code, start from header
2. observe any attached cpp file from the header.
3. expand header file recursively (easier said then done, but it's doable)
4. use the removecomment tool is a plus because you can actually focus on the merging of pure code.
